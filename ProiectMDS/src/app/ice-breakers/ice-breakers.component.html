    <h1>Ice-breakers ideas</h1>

<ol type="1">
    <li>Would You Rather</li> 
    <p> A classic game played at summer camps everywhere, "Would You Rather" is an excellent, quick ice breaker for the workplace. 
        Next time you're settling into a meeting or team bonding outing, take turns going around the table and asking each person a 
        "Would You Rather" question. Here are a few "Would You Rather" questions to get you started:</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>Would you rather only have summer or winter for the rest of your life?</li>
            <li>Would you rather go on a hike or see a movie?</li>
            <li>Would you rather never use social media sites and apps again or never watch another movie or TV show?</li>
            <li>Would you rather have a horrible short-term memory or a horrible long-term memory?</li>
        </ul>

      <li>Bucket List</li>
      <p>
        Outside of the workplace, your teammates are people with aspirations and goals you wouldn't know about from the average coffee chat.
        Have team members share some bucket list items they want to achieve in the future. Not only can these be inspirational,
        but they also open the floor for team members to encourage one another to pursue their dreams, too.
        It's a particularly uplifting team-bonding activity that will bring your team even closer together.
      </p>

      <li>Arts and Crafts</li>
      <p>
        Making something with your team can be a great opportunity to learn something new and keep decorative mementos in your space to
        remind you of your team. Have everyone follow the same instructions to make a craft like simple origami, a drawing, or painting
      </p>

    <li>The Handshake</li> 
    <p> This ice breaker lets individuals ease up and have a little fun without a hassle. It’s simple — divide the group into pairs of two 
        and have them make the most creative handshake they can in a couple of minutes. If you have more time on your hands, have the pairs 
        split up after showing off their super cool shake and make even more creative ones with new partners. It’s hard to play these games 
        without sharing a laugh, something we all could use in the workday.</p>
